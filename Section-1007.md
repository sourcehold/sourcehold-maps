## When wiped:
Units on towers and gates are wonky, they are stending on the ledge.
Gates have seem to be moved on top of the walls, very weird.
Or gates move on top of elevated terrain (plateau).

After breaking the gate, one cannot enter, because of high terrain.

I think the towers and gates are drawn differently as well.

Ruins are also encoded with values 16400 and 8208.
